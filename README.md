## Why Stellance Exists

The freelance economy is broken:

- Experts wait days or weeks to get paid for work delivered immediately
- Platforms take 20–30% commissions and lock up funds
- Clients must pay before value is confirmed
- Small jobs and milestones are inefficient and expensive

Stellance solves this by moving payments onto the Stellar network with trustless escrow and fast settlement.

## What Makes Stellance Different

Stellance is built around instant, on-chain payment delivery rather than delayed invoicing.

### Core Principles

- Pay only for completed work and approved milestones
- Escrow funds until value is delivered
- Keep fees low with Stellar transaction economics
- Make blockchain seamless for users

### How It Works

1. **Connect**
   - Freelancers and clients connect a Stellar wallet.
2. **Create job/contract**
   - Clients post jobs and hire freelancers with contract terms.
3. **Fund escrow**
   - Clients lock funds into an on-chain escrow flow.
4. **Deliver work**
   - Freelancers submit milestones or deliverables.
5. **Release payment**
   - Approved work triggers payment release to the freelancer.
